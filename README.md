# Submission Notes

I'm sorry this is a mess to grade.  I've got everything working, but I have a lot of polishing to do to get it submission-ready, but I've got 20 minutes and I really, really, really want to get something in on time so I'm submitting what I have and should have a more coherent re-submission in a couple hours.



## Questions
  * ![lecture vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEaTXfEEKxI) around 23:00, i never got the live test results working.  How does John do this?

  * What am I supposed to deploy to heroku?  I don't have a database.

  * How do I write npm scripts?
  

### Feature Tasks

it can not have the same properties as the in-class sample code (other than the id)

[x] use the JSON parser included with the body-parser module as a middleware component to parse the request body on POST and PUT routes
